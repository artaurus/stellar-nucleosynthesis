# Nucleosynthesis in a crude stellar model

The only preliminary is to create a directory named 'images', which is
where the graphical results will be saved. Output data is written to a
log.txt file, which will be created automatically when the main module
is first executed. The console only counts the iteration and fuel so
that the user may intuit the program execution time.

## 1. The stellar model
A star is initialised as a set of proton number, neutron number, and
mass number matrices.

## 2. Gravitation


## 3. Nuclear fusion
